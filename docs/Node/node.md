The Zond Node is the main building block powering the QRL Zond POS blockchain. The node is responsible for syncing blocks, agreeing on consensis for chain operations, and is the means to relay new transactions and signatures onto the network.

Once connected and synced with the rest of the network the node can be used by clients wanting to interact with the chain.


## Installation

Project Zond can be installed on all major platforms, Mac, Windows and Linux. A modern PC is required however most computers are able to run the program.




## Usage


Interacting with the node can be done using RPC or with the `zond-cli` tools.
